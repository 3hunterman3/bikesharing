## Overview of Project
- The point of this project was to be able to convinece investors to the idea of bike sharing using CitiBikes data. To do this we use Citibikes public data and then changing the tripduration into a datetime data type to utilize it in out analysis. With the csv file we then analyzed the data to show investors various different signs that it would be a good investment.

## Analysis
- The first step was to convert the data in jupyter notebook:
![data](data)
- This then shows the information being converted:
![info](info)

This shows the first graph on tableau which shows the number of trips based on gender
![tab1](tab1)

This shows the data count of people per gender and is made using a pie chart this shows Male and Female counts and also shows individuals that did not mention their gender of was not provided.
![tab2](tab2)

This shows the data of users trips based on the gender and it is represented by a heat map type of data point it also shows the customers and the individuals who are subscribers.
![tab3](tab3)

This next data point is trips by gender and shows what times people used the bikes most often and what days are most used.
![tab4](tab4)

The next data point I made using tableau describes the Trips by weekday by each hour and representes/shows the busiest hours by the days.
![tab5](tab5)

I created a line grapgh that shows the checkout times by gender and I can filter the data by the tripdurations and I seperated the data points by gender.
![tab6](tab6)

The final graph I created on tableau represents the overall checkout times by users of citibike and it is sperated by minutes and filtered through tripdurations.
![tab7](tab7)

## Predictions
I belive that increasing rental prices during busy times will increase the amount people will subscribe so they can save money. I also belive that we should invest in durable bikes that are also cheap to minimize repair costs. Another idea I belive should be added is to add more bikes in areas where it is busy and adding less bikes to areas where it is not utilized as often.
