## Overview of Project
- The point of this project was to be able to convinece investors to the idea of bike sharing using CitiBikes data. To do this we use Citibikes public data and then changing the tripduration into a datetime data type to utilize it in out analysis. With the csv file we then analyzed the data to show investors various different signs that it would be a good investment.
